# The Feel App
## Assignment Description
This project is based off of a group project that was created in LaunchCode's LiftOff program. The idea came from 
a group brainstorming session. After the program completed, I wanted to take the opportunity to implement different features such as utilizing 
the LocalDate object in Java to track entries.

### Overview
In a fast paced modern world, most people find it difficult to even have the opportunity to take a seat! 
Much less to step back and assess an often neglected aspect of mental health.

So we are building a tool in which through small, easy to follow steps, we encourage people to take a little time for themselves.
